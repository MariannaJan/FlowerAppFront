## Flower classifier app

Front-end for an app allowing for classification of flowers on the basis of a photo processed by a PyTorch model, done in Angular 7 plus Angular Material.

The app was created as a side project for the [Udacity and Facebook PyTorch Scholarship Challenge](https://www.udacity.com/facebook-pytorch-scholarship).

Due to some technical problems the original repository was changed and there is no sign of my work on the frontend of the application. The repository for the whole application can be found [here](https://github.com/kedevked/flowers-classifier).

Working version of the app can be found [here](http://kedevked.github.io/flowers-classifier).

### Development

- install all the dependencies

        npm install

- serve the frontend
     
        npm start
